## Application instructions

* To apply for summer school, fill out [this form](https://mlss-25-registration.paperform.co).
* Since the number of people who can attend the summer school in person is limited, we will only be able to accept selected applications. 
* the applicants are required to submit a PDF with a poster describing their research. The quality of the poster will be the most important decision factor.
* A poster can be about one of the two following topics (choose ONLY ONE):
    * **[Research]** Your own project related to Machine Learning or applications of ML / Data science to Chemistry, Biology, and other school-related themes. If you have worked on any research projects in the past, we recommend choosing this option.
    * **[Reproduction]** a project reproducing the results of a paper published by someone else in a top conference or journal (e.g. NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, TPAMI, JMLR, TMLR) in the past 5 years.
* Poster tips:
    * The poster has to be self-explanatory, i.e., the viewer should be able to understand the general idea without oral explanations.
    * There are a lot of resources for preparing good posters, e.g., this [ETH guide](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/usys/ibp/soil-terrestrial-env-physics-dam/education/sientific_comm/2015/3-creating_scientific_poster_ethz_2015.pdf).
    * If you’re looking for inspiration, on the websites of NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR conferences you can find some of the posters presented in previous years.
* Technical requirements:
    * Use any tools you want to prepare the poster – Latex, Google Slides, Adobe Photoshop, etc.
    * You can use any format for the poster you want. Both vertical and horizontal are OK. If in doubt, we recommend 91cm (H) x 61cm (W) (slightly bigger than A1).
* Evaluation criteria:
    * **Topic** - Ideally about works at the intersection of ML and drug design or science in general, although pure-ML presentations are also OK.
    * **Quality of explanation** - Ideally, a person with a basic background in ML and science should be able to understand the poster. It’s okay to simplify certain things if it helps convey the message.
    * **Technical correctness** - Are the concepts presented in the poster explained correctly? Is the crucial work cited property? It’s okay to cite only 2-3 most relevant works.
    * **General presentation** - Preparing your own figures as a visual aid is a plus.
    * **Novelty** - if the poster describes your own work, bonus points might be added for originality, scope, etc.
    * **Brevity** - Max character limit: 5000 characters. Don’t feel obligated to fill in the full 5000 characters, 2000 characters are also fine if the main ideas are well presented.

* In addition to the poster, we ask you to prepare a short statement about your research interests. A few sentences (max 2000 characters, but don’t feel pressured to use all available space): describe your research interests, projects related to ML you worked on or would like to work on, and motivation for attending the summer school.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
